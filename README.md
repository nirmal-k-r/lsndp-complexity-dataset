# lsndp-complexity-dataset

This repository contains the dataset and model developed in the paper "A framework for complexity-based categorisation of Np-hard Liner Shipping Network Design Problems" by Nirmal Kumar Rampersand and Oomesh Gukhool. 

### Dataset
The dataset is a collection of 30 Liner Shipping Network Design problems extracted from peer-reviewed journal articles and conference articles. It contains data about different complexity-related features. The features have been encoded using the categorical labels as described in the dataset. The dataset is in the form of a XLSX (Excel) file.

### Model
The model is a tuned K-Nearest Neighbors model trained on the dataset using the Sklearn Library in Python. The model is used to predict the complexity category of  Liner Shipping Network Design problems based on the complexity-related features. The model is saved in the form of a pickle file.

### Usage
- The model can be imported using Pickle after importing the necessary libraries.
- The model can also be used via our website accessible at the following link: [LSNDP Complexity categorisation tool](https://complexity.coderfaculty.com)
